# Neovim

You can use Tidewave with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) through the [MCP Hub extension](https://github.com/ravitemer/mcphub.nvim),
and integration with [Avante](https://github.com/ravitemer/mcphub.nvim/wiki/Avante) or
[CodeCompanion](https://github.com/ravitemer/mcphub.nvim/wiki/CodeCompanion).

With MCP Hub added, create a file at
`~/.config/mcphub/servers.json` and add the following contents.

### MCP Proxy

See the [MCP proxy documentation](guides/mcp_proxy.md).

      "args": [
        "http://localhost:$PORT/tidewave/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows:

```json

  "mcpServers": {
    "tidewave": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-proxy.exe",
      "args": [
        "http://localhost:$PORT/tidewave/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Where `$PORT` is the port your web application is running on.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tidewave": {
      "url": "http://localhost:$PORT/tidewave/mcp"
    }

}
```

Where `$PORT` is the port your web application is running on. If the `mcp-proxy` command

And you are good to go! If your application uses SQL database, you can verify
